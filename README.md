# Secure-File-Management-System
Developed a secure file management system that incorporates authentication mechanisms (password-based, two-factor), protection measures (access control, encryption), and detection of common security threats (buffer overflow, malware). Users should be able to perform file operations like read, write, share, and view metadata securely.
